    <ul>
        <li>Links are created using the a element.</li>
        <li> The a element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.</li>
        <li> If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.</li>
        <li>You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.</li>
        <li> You can use the id attribute to target elements within  a page that can be linked to.</li>
        <li>Links are the defining feature of the web because  they allow you to move from one web page to another enabling the
        very idea of browsing or surfing. </li>
        <li> You will commonly come across the following types of links:</li>
        <li> Links from one website to another </li>
        <li>Links from one page to another on the same website</li>
        <li>Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page </li>
        <li>Links that open in a new browser window </li>
        <li>Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone</li>
        <li>Links are created using the a element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that
        you want people to go to when they click on the link.
        <li> Users can click on anything that appears between the opening a tag and the closing /a tag and will be taken to the page 
        specified in the href attribute. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="email_links">Email Links</h3>
        <li> To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified
        email address, you use the a element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with 
        mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.</li>
        <li><a href="mailto:irfanramzandevolper@gmail.com">Email IRFAN</a></li>
        <h3 id="opening">Opening Links in a New Window</h3>
        <li>If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the "target" attribute on the opening "a" tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.</li>
        <li>One of the most common reasons a web page author might want a link to be opened in a new window is if it points to another website. In such cases,
            they hope the user will return to the window containing their site after finishing looking at the other one.</li>
        <h3 id="absolute">Absolute and Relative URLs</h3>
        <li>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Every web page has its own URL. This is the web address that you would type 
        into a browser if you wanted to visit that specific page.</li>
        <li>When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is 
        known as an absolute URL.</li>
        <li>An absolute URL starts with the domain name for that site, and can be followed by the path to a specific page. If no 
        page is specified, the site will display the homepage.</li>
        <li>When linking to other pages within the same site, you can use relative URLs. These are like a shorthand version of 
        absolute URLs because you do not need to specify the domain name.</li>
        <li> If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value of the href attribute is just the name of the file.</li>
        <li> If you have different pages of a site in different folders, then you can use a slightly more complex syntax to indicate where 
        the page is in relation to the current page. </li>
