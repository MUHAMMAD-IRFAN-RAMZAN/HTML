     <h4>There is three main part of html BODY,HEAD and TITLE.</h4>
      <h4>Title</h4>
      The contents of the TITLE element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where
you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your
browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).
<h4>Body</h4>
You met the BODY element in the first example we created.Everything inside this element is shown 
    inside the main browser window.
<h4>Head</h4>
Before the BODY element you will often see a HEAD element. This contains information about the
page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window that is 
highlighted in blue on the opposite page).You will usually find a TITLE element inside the HEAD element.

<ul> HTML pages are text documents. </ul>
<ul> HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.</ul>
<ul>Tags are often referred to as elements.</ul>
<ul> Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.</ul>
<ul> Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.</ul>
<ul> Attributes require a name and a value.</ul>
<ul> To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.</ul>
