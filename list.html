        <h2> LISTS </h2>
        There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
<li> Ordered lists use numbers.</li>
<li> Unordered lists use bullets.</li>
<li> Definition lists are used to define terminology.</li>
<li> Lists can be nested inside one another</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
   <h3> There are lots of occasions when we
    need to use lists. HTML provides us with
    three different types:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
    numbered. For example, the list might be <br> a set of steps for
    a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
    where each point <br> needs to be identified by a section
    number.</li>
<li> Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
    (rather than characters that indicate order).</li>
<li> Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
    definitions for each of those terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tag ol is used for order list. </p>
<p>Lets create a fruit list. </p>
<ol>
    <li>APPLE</li>
    <li>MANGO</li>
    <li>GRAPES</li>
    <li>BANANA</li>
    <li>PINEAPPLE</li>
</ol>
<p>Tag ul is used for Unordered list.</p>
<p>Lets create friends name list.</p>
<ul>
    <li>ALI</li>
    <li>ZAIN</li>
    <li>SHAYAN</li>
    <li>SALMAN</li>
    <li>REHAN</li>
</ul>
<h3>DEFINITION LIST</h3>
<p>
The definition list is created with the tag dl element and usually
consists of a series of terms and their definitions. <br>
Inside the tag dl element you will
usually see pairs of taf dt and
dd elements.
</p>
<p>
    This tag dt is used to contain the term
    being defined (the definition
    term).</p>
<p>
This tag dd is used to contain the
definition.
Sometimes you might see a list
where there are two terms used
for the same definition or two
different definitions for the same
term.
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Sashimi</dt>
    <dd>Sliced raw fish that is served with
     condiments such as shredded daikon radish or
     ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce</dd>
    <dt>Scale</dt>
    <dd>A device used to accurately measure the
     weight of ingredients</dd>
    <dd>A technique by which the scales are removed
     from the skin of a fish</dd>
    <dt>Scamorze</dt>
    <dd>An Italian cheese usually made from whole
     cow's milk (although it was traditionally made
     from buffalo milk)</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>
        You can put a second list inside
an li element to create a sub list or nested list. <br>
Browsers display nested lists
indented further than the parent
list. In nested unordered lists,
the browser will usually change
the style of the bullet point too.
