    <h2>FORMS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Form controls live inside a 'form' element. This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a method 
        and id attribute too.</li>
        <li>Every 'form' element requires an action attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the 
            in the form when it is submitted.</li>
        <li>Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.</li>
        <li>The 'input' element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating.</li>
        <li>When the type attribute has a value of text, it creates a singleline text input.</li> 
        <li>Each form control requires a name attribute. The value of this attribute identifies the form control and is sent along with the information they enter to the server.</li>
        <li>You can use the maxlength attribute to limit the number of characters a user may enter into the text field. Its value is the number of characters they may enter.
            <br> For example, if you were asking for a year, the maxlength attribute could have a value of 4.</li>
        <li>When the type attribute has a value of password it creates a text box that acts just like a single-line text input, except the characters are blocked out. <br>
            They are hidden so if someone is looking over the user's shoulder, they cannot see sensitive data such as passwords</li>
        <li>The <textarea> element is used to create a mutli-line text input. Unlike other input elements this is not an empty element. It should therefore have an opening and a closing tag. </li>
