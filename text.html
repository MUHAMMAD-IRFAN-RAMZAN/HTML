    <h2>TEXT</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).</li>
<li> They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

        <h4>We are learning structure in html using text and elements.</h4>
<ul>HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).</ul>
<ul> They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).</ul>
<p>
     <h4> HTML has six "levels" of HEADINGS</h4>
  h1 is used for main headings. h2 is used for subheadings If there are further sections
    under the subheadings then the h3 element is used, and so on... <br>
    Browsers display the contents of headings at different sizes. The contents of an h1 element is
    the largest, and the contents of an h6 element is the smallest. <br>
    The exact size at which each browser shows the headings can vary slightly. Users can also
    adjust the size of text in their browser. <br>
    You will see how to control the size of text, its color and the fonts used when we come to look at CSS.</p>
    <p>To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening p 
        tag and closing /p tag.</p>
